<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview
This repository stores my code solutions about data structures and algorithms that I learned while interning at FPT Telecom - IoT lab. The solutioin code will be divided into specifically named folders, in each code solution will contain a specific path linking to problems on Codeforces, Hackerrank, uva, spoj...<br>
## Roadmap
### Week 1
Learn how to evaluate and analyze the complexity of the Algorithmic Complexity (Algorithmic Complexity).
### Week 2
* Basic data structures: Linked List, Stack & Queue, String.<br>
* Sorting algorithms: Selection sort, Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort.<br>
* Besides learning the implementation and operation of the above basic data structures and algorithms, knowing how to use the STL (Standard Template Library) library from C++ is also essential to be able to solve the problems convenient. 
### Week 3
Review and practice the knowledge learned by solving problems.
### Week 4
Find path in graph algorithms:
* Breadth First Search (BFS): Find single source shortest path in an unweighted graph (using Queue) - Time complexity: O(V+E).
* Depth First Search (DFS): Traverse through more edges to reach a destination vertex from a source (using Stack) - Time complexity: O(V+E).
### Week 5
* Data structures: Heap (MinHeap and MaxHeap)
* Dijkstra algorithms: Find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the weighted graph (using Heap - priority_queue in STL library) - Time complexity: O(ElogV).
### Week 6
Continue about find path in graph algorithms:
* Bellman-Ford: Find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges. - Time complexity: O(E.V).
* Floyd-Warshall: Find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed graph - Time complexity: O(n^3).
### Week 7
Searching algorithms:
* Binary search.
* Linear search.
### Week 8
Review knowledge, solving problems.
